# Chambliss Grandslam Heatmap

- HTML app
- Background is white
- 3x3 black grid, 2 pixel lines
- Register clicks in the area within and surrounding the grid
- When a point/pixel is clicked, it becomes redder
- Apply a blur so that the change in redness is gradual, like in a weather map
- NOTE: not every pixel in the same grid tile has to be the same color; in fact, this is almost certainly not the case
