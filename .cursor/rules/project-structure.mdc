# Chambliss Grandslam Heatmap Project Structure

This is a single-page HTML application that creates an interactive tennis court heatmap visualization.

## Core Files

- [index.html](mdc:index.html) - Main application file containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [project-specs.md](mdc:project-specs.md) - Original project specifications and requirements

## Project Architecture

The application is built as a self-contained HTML file with:
- Canvas-based rendering for pixel-perfect heatmap visualization
- Object-oriented JavaScript with a `HeatmapApp` class
- Inline CSS for modern, responsive styling
- No external dependencies - runs in any modern browser

## Key Components

1. **Canvas Rendering**: 600x600px canvas with 3x3 grid (180px per cell)
2. **Heatmap Logic**: Pixel-level heat tracking with radial distribution
3. **Blur Effects**: Real-time blur application for smooth color transitions
4. **User Controls**: Intensity adjustment and clear functionality

## Design Principles

- White background with black 2-pixel grid lines
- Red heat gradient that intensifies with clicks
- Smooth, weather map-like blur transitions
- Individual pixel granularity within grid cells
