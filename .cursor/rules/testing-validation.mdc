# Testing and Validation Procedures

## Functional Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Canvas renders 3x3 grid with black 2px lines on white background
- [ ] Click detection works across entire canvas area
- [ ] Heat accumulates with each click (pixels get redder)
- [ ] Blur effect creates smooth color transitions
- [ ] Clear button resets heatmap to original state

### Interactive Controls
- [ ] Intensity +/- buttons modify click strength
- [ ] Intensity value updates in real-time
- [ ] Intensity bounds are respected (0.1 to 5.0 range)
- [ ] Controls remain responsive after multiple interactions

### Visual Validation
- [ ] Grid lines remain crisp and visible over heatmap
- [ ] Heat distribution follows radial pattern
- [ ] Color gradients are smooth and natural
- [ ] No visual artifacts or rendering glitches
- [ ] Pixels within same grid cell can have different colors

## Browser Compatibility

Test in major browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari (if available)

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Smooth interaction with rapid clicking
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Canvas redraws efficiently
- [ ] Blur effects don't cause lag

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Clicking at canvas edges
- [ ] Maximum heat intensity reached
- [ ] Rapid successive clicks
- [ ] Window resize behavior
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions (if applicable)

## Code Quality Checks

- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Clean HTML validation
- [ ] Proper event listener cleanup
- [ ] Efficient pixel manipulation algorithms
